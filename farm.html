                The seemingly abundance of net sown area of 141.2 million hectares and
                total cropped area of 189.7 million hectares (1999-2000) pales into
                insignificance when we see that it is divided into economically
                unviable small and scattered holdings. The average size of holdings
                was 2.28 hectares in 1970-71 which was reduced to 1.82 hectares in
                1980-81 and 1.50 hectares in 1995-96. The size of the holdings will
                further decrease with the infinite Sub-division of the land holdings.
                The problem of small and fragmented holdings is more serious in
                densely populated and intensively cultivated states like Kerala, West
                Bengal, Bihar and eastern part of Uttar Pradesh where the average size
                of land holdings is less than one hectare and in certain parts it is
                less than even 0.5 hectare.
