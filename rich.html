            <h1>Food Wastage</h1>
            <p>n the United States, food waste is estimated at between 30-40 percent of the food supply. This estimate, based on estimates from USDA's Economic Research Service of 31 percent food loss at the retail and consumer levels, corresponded to approximately 133 billion pounds and $161 billion worth of food in 2010.</p>

                <h2>Store food correctly</h2>
                <p>Perishable items, such as fruits and vegetables, each have their best way to store to avoid spoilage.
                   Always transfer leftovers from open cans into a suitable container. Do not store it in the can.

                <h2>Freeze extras</h2>
                <p>Freezing foods can help preserve them for later use and prevent them from spoiling. Many fresh fruits 
                   and vegetables keep well when frozen, extending their shelf life and reducing waste. Other foods 
                   may preserve well in the freezer as well, such as bread, meats, and even some prepared dishes.

                <h2>Eat leftovers</h2>
                <p>As part of a meal plan to reduce waste, many people choose 1 or 2 days each week to eat any leftovers 
                   they may have stored in the fridge or freezer. This helps reduce waste from individual meals and keeps 
                   the fridge tidy.

                <h2>Make a weekly menu</h2>
                <p>Making a meal menu for the week may help some people organize their 
                   food usage and cut back on waste. Using online tools or cookbooks 
                   to help plan out meals for the week can a person to compile an 
                   accurate shopping list. It may take a few weeks for each household 
                   to get the menu right, but having a set weekly menu might help some 
                   people reduce the guesswork around meals and avoid wasting food.</p>

                <h2>Avoid buying too much</h2>
                <p>One of the simplest ways to avoid food waste as a consumer is 
                   to buy less. A packed fridge may look appealing, but it may 
                   lead to food waste if the household cannot eat all of the food.
                   Taking a couple of shorter trips to the grocery store each week 
                   rather than one longer trip may prevent people from buying 
                   too much food and help cut back on waste.

                <h2>Understand the dates on food</h2>
                <p>Many manufacturers put different labels on foods, such as “sell by” or 
                   “use by.” These dates help markets know when to rotate their stock, but 
                   they can be confusing for consumers. The Food and Drug Administration 
                   (FDA) estimate that up to 20% of food waste comes from the confusion 
                   over these dates.

                <h2>Compost scraps</h2>
                <p>Most meal preparation leaves scraps from the stems, peels, and unusable bits of food. Even coffee grounds and tea leaves make
                   a great addition to a compost heap. Creating a compost heap is one way to help reduce waste by turning even these scraps 
                   into nutrient-rich fertilizer.
